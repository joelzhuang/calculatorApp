# calculatorApp
My first android app which is making a calculator

Some of the code is from the following tutorial:
http://www.androidauthority.com/build-a-calculator-app-721910/

I have alternated the code, so that the input is stored in a char array, and the calculation method is called at the end, doing the final calculation.

Backlog:
Involve bedmas
